    <h1>Global Warming Project</h1>
    <h2>By Justin Almonor</h2>
    <p>
     For my final project, I decided to animate something that I felt was important to me and to others. That is global warming. Global warming is bad for the earth and I want people to realize that we must make a change to save it. The media I chose to demonstrate this is Adobe After Effects. I believed After Effects was a perfect software for creating my animation.
